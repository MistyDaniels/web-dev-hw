  <p class="me-description" id="more-about-me">
    My name is Misty Daniels and my native name is Morning Mist Woman.
    I am a 26 year old Lakota woman, and I have spent most of my life living
    on a reservation.
    I moved to Missoula 3 years ago, after I received my associates degree in
    Computer Technology from the Fort Peck Community College.
    Adjusting to such a large city has been difficult to say the least, as
    I've never been so far from family and friends, or in a place with so many
    people!
    I was not introduced to my native roots until I was a teenage, when
    I received my native name.
    I was very fortunate to learn as much as I could from my aunt, Helen, and
    what I wasnt able to learn from her I read in books by fellow natives.

  <h2 class="location">Home</h2>
  <p class="location-descprition" id="home-description">
    I come from a very small town called Wolf Point. This town is located on
    the Fort Peck Reservatin here in Montana. Wolf Point is just over
    10 hours away from Missoula. The area is much different that this lovely
    city. Yes, I said city, because the population of Wolf Point is just over
    2000 people.
    Wolf point is located in the badlands and plains of the state where people
    measure distance by how long you must drive to reach your location.
    The area is extremely flat, and on clear days you can see neighboring towns
     from your porch.

     Below, you can see a map of the area!

<h2 class="reason">My Process</h2>
<p class="reasoning" id="process">
  The reason I chose frybread as a topic is primarily because I'm extrememly
  homesick! Silly, I know. But making frybread is a way for me to feel like
  Im close to my family, and hopefully if people do try this recipe they can
  feel close to home as well.</br>
