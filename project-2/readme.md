###Project 2
This week I created a new index and readme file for a series of new webpages we will work on later.
I learned that it can be important to leave messages, reminders, todos, notes, and comments for yourself or others who may be looking over your files.
      *<!-- Comments are a really nifty! -->
      <!-- They will come in handy when we start going further -->*

I also learned that organization is key! Its polite to keep things as neat and readable as possible. It will help myself and others when we go through our coding.

One thing I hadnt known before, was semantics are pretty important! At first I thought it was simply a different way to italicize or bold text, but it also affects how screen readers pronounce words. I thought that was interesting.

As for the future, I plan creating a tutorial for making frybread. It is simple enough that it wont be overwhelming, but with enough steps to build a few pages.
