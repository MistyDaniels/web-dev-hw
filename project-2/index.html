      <h1><i>A brief history of frybread</i></h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Frybread is a common and extremely popular dish for many Native
        American tribes. This staple was developed by the Navajo in the
        1800's during 4 years of captivity by the US government.</p>

      <p>The Navajo were provided with meager rations of lard, flour,
        baking soda, sugar, and powdered milk. These few items let to
        conceptualize this recipe.</p>

      <p>Today, nearly every tribe has its own version of frybread, with
        every family claiming the best recipe. It is a staple to Native American
         feasts and ceremonies and is a common treat at carnivals and fairs.</p>

      <p>In the following page you will find my own version of frybread. Follow
        along or expiriment for yourself to see what you may enjoy.<p>
