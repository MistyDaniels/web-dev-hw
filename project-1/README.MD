`The assignment was a little confusing to be honest, but I did learn quite a bit! I've coded in C# before, but Markdown is not something Im used to **whatsoever**.`

Things that I've learned!


1. How to organize my files
2. How to name files
  * Dont use funky characters
  * Spaces
  * Or begin file names with numbers
3. Also did you know cables *run through the oceans*?!
