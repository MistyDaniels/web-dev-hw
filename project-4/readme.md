# Fourth README


Im still having trouble getting my image
to center but I forgot it for now.
I was able to successfully get the page
to change when I changed the window size
which is great!
It actually looks really great as it is
so I'm not sure if I'll add another b
break point or not. We'll see.
I didnt have too much trouble, and
looking at some other sites really helped me along.
***

I got 2 images that I'll be using. One is of my color palette and the other
is of my wireframes.
(./images/palette.png)
(./images/wireframe.png)
But Im having a lot of trouble getting them to sit next to one another?


***

This site will be about Responsive Web Design (RWD) and why they are
important/should be used. I want there to be at least one image, of the code
I'll be using myself or of my concept wireframe that I'll be making in photoshop.
I'd like at least 3 or 4 paragraphs supplying information or argument for this
case. As for the aesthetic, I want it to be very clean and striaght forward.
I may take from Atom itself and follow its color scheme as it is very readable
for me, it'll also be a little fun for fellow students to see, I hope!
