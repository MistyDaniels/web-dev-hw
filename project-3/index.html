<p> <div class="intro">
John Dies at the End is not a book for those with weak stomachs or a common
sense of humor, but if you enjoy low-brow comedy and horror this might be
good for you!
From the editor of <a href="http://www.cracked.com">Cracked</a>, David Wong has brought us a
unique book documenting the fictional adventures of himself and his best friends,
 John and Amy.
In the first installment of the series, we follow the adventures of David, John,
and Amy as they expiriment with a new sentient drug called Soy Sauce. This drug
is lethal to all who use it, eventually. The trip allows whoever takes it to slip
through dimensions and time, leaving them susceptible to creatures such as Wig Monsters,
 and the cocky Korrok, who plans on taking over our universe.
