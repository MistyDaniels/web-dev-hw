    Upclosed</a>:
    <blockquote cite="https://www.upclosed.com">Wong was born in Lawrenceville,
  Illinois. He and fellow Internet writer John Cheese (real name Mack Leighty)
  went to high school together and met during an art class they shared. Wong then
  attended the Southern Illinois University (SIU) radio-television program,
  graduating in 1997. While at SIU, he was part of a TV show on Alt.news cable
  TV called Consumer Advocate. A number of episodes were produced.
He lived in Marion, Illinois until 2014, when he moved to Nashville.
