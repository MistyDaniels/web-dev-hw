# My Third Readme

## Misty Daniels

***

After reading through this weeks CSS lesson, I'm starting to formulate some
ideas for the coming project.
I want to make a 90's style page, maybe not as ugly, but with the eye
burning color scheme. Get a little nostalgic with it.
I think I'll base its content off of one of my favorite books, John Dies
at the End. Hopefully it wont be too graphic.
The more I think about it, I do want this page to have some sharp contrast, or
something very bold, I believe something like that would flow really well with
the book series.
I'm going to try not to go full comic sans neon pink on this page, despite
how hilarious and fun that would be. But we'll see.
Fortunately I shouldn't have to worry too much about images since the book
was recently been turned into a movie. Though I will also either take a
picture of my copy of the book, or find images of it online.
Maybe I can find some fanart that I'm able to use for this site?

Color ideas: Black, navy, deep purple, neon red, neon orange, neon purple/blue.

Possible quote:
"Scientists talk about dark matter, the invisible, mysterious substance
that occupies the space between stars. Dark matter makes up 99.99 percent
of the universe, and they dont know what it is. Well I do. Its apathy.
Thats the truth of it; pile together everything we know and care about in the
universe and it will still be nothing more than a tiny speck in the middle
of a vast black ocean of Who Gives a Fuck"

or

“From day one it was like society was this violent, complicated dance and
everybody had taken lessons but me. Knocked to the floor again, climbing to my
feet each time, bloody and humiliated. Always met with disapproving faces,
waiting for me to leave so I'd stop fucking up the party.

The wanted to push me outside, where the freaks huddled in the cold. Out there
with the misfits, the broken, the glazed-eye types who can only watch as the
normals enjoy their shiny new cars and careers and marriages and vacations with
the kids.

The freaks spend their lives shambling around, wondering how they got left out,
mumbling about conspiracy theories and bigfoot sightings. Their encounters with
the world are marked by awkward conversations and stifled laughter, hidden
smirks and rolled eyes. And worst of all, pity.”

Im not sure yet if I should use the short biography on his amazon as a cited
source, especially since David Wong is a psuedonym for his real name,
Jason Pargin.

I'll flesh things out more as I go.
